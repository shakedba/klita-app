```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Context

Ask:
- What product, company, or market are you analyzing?
- What's the purpose? (strategic planning, market entry, investor prep, annual review)
- Any specific frameworks to focus on? Or run all four?
- What's your current position in this market?

### Step 2: Run the Analysis

Apply four skills in sequence, each building on insights from the previous:

**SWOT Analysis** (apply **swot-analysis** skill):
- Internal: Strengths and Weaknesses
- External: Opportunities and Threats
- Actionable recommendations for each quadrant

**PESTLE Analysis** (apply **pestle-analysis** skill):
- Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental factors
- Impact assessment and timeline for each factor

**Porter's Five Forces** (apply **porters-five-forces** skill):
- Competitive rivalry, supplier power, buyer power, threat of substitutes, threat of new entrants
- Overall industry attractiveness rating

**Ansoff Matrix** (apply **ansoff-matrix** skill):
- Market penetration, market development, product development, diversification
- Risk-adjusted growth opportunities

### Step 3: Synthesize

Cross-reference findings across frameworks to identify:
- **Converging signals**: What multiple frameworks agree on
- **Strategic imperatives**: Actions that appear critical across analyses
- **Key risks**: Threats and forces to mitigate
- **Growth opportunities**: Best risk-adjusted opportunities

### Step 4: Generate Report

```

Save as markdown.

### Step 5: Offer Next Steps

- "Want me to **build a product strategy** based on these findings?"
- "Should I **analyze specific competitors** identified in Porter's analysis?"
- "Want me to **design a pricing strategy** for the market penetration opportunity?"

## Notes

- Use web research to ground analysis in current market data, not just general knowledge
- PESTLE factors should include specific regulations and trend signals — not generic observations
- The synthesis section is the most valuable part — it's where frameworks talk to each other
